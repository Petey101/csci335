This saturday, we will have two contests, do not miss the opportunity to solve the problems:
- Biweekly Leetcode contest.
- Weekly Leetcode contest.
Check the detail schedule by yourself. Usually, it happens biweekly: 10:30 am to 12:00
weekly: 10:30 pm to 12:00.

We increase the weights for correctly solving problems. Let's earn more credits and sharp your coding skills.

You can earn credits from both contests.
- If you participate in the contest, you can get 40 points.
- If you solve n problems, you can earn extra 30*n points.

Suppose you participate biweekly contest, and solve one problem
and you participate weekly contest, and solve zero problem, 
you will earn:
40 + 30 + 40 = 110 points
If you solve all the 8 problems, you will earn 
(40 + 30*4)  * 2 = 320
